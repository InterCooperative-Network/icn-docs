# ICN Architecture

This section explains the philosophy, high-level structure, and core components that make up the InterCooperative Network (ICN) system. It's intended for engineers, system architects, and anyone seeking a deeper technical understanding of ICN.

## Contents

The primary document in this section is:

- [`overview.md`](./overview.md) â€” Provides a big-picture view of the ICN architecture, its conceptual layers, and an introduction to its core components and modules.

Detailed documentation for specific sub-systems (like Identity, Economy, Runtime, Networking, Governance internals) will be linked from the `overview.md` or added as separate files in this section as they are developed.

## Contributing

ICN's architecture is a foundational aspect of the project, and its documentation is collaboratively developed. If you have insights, suggestions for improving clarity, or wish to contribute to detailing specific components:

*   Please open an issue to discuss your proposed changes or additions.
*   Submit a pull request with your contributions.

We aim for these documents to be accurate, clear, and reflective of the evolving system. Refer to the main [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for general contribution guidelines.
