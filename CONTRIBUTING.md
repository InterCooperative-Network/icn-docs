# Contributing to ICN Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the InterCooperative Network (ICN) documentation! We welcome improvements of all kinds, from fixing typos and clarifying explanations to adding new sections or examples.

As a community-driven project, your contributions are vital to building a comprehensive and accessible resource for everyone involved with ICN.

## Getting Started

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the `icn-docs` repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/icn-docs.git
    cd icn-docs
    ```
3.  **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. Choose a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `fix-typo-onboarding`, `add-economy-mana-details`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

## Making Changes

*   Ensure your contributions are made in Markdown.
*   Follow the existing style and tone of the documentation (see the root `README.md` and other files for examples).
*   If you are adding a new section or a significant amount of content, consider discussing it first in our GitHub Discussions (see below) to ensure it aligns with the project's direction.
*   Keep your changes focused. Each pull request should address a single issue or a coherent set of changes.

## Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

1.  **Commit Your Changes**: Once you've made your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "docs: Describe your changes here"
    ```
2.  **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
3.  **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original `icn-docs` repository on GitHub and open a pull request from your forked branch to the `main` branch (or the relevant target branch).
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining the purpose and nature of your changes.
    *   Reference any relevant issues if applicable.

Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers, who may provide feedback or request changes. We aim to review contributions promptly.

## Where to Ask Questions

This is the best place for Q&A, sharing ideas, and engaging with the broader ICN community.

## Code of Conduct
