# RFC-0000: Title Here

## Summary

A concise (1-2 sentence) explanation of the feature, change, or problem this RFC addresses.

## Motivation

*   Why is this change necessary or beneficial for ICN?
*   What problem does it solve? What opportunities does it enable?
*   How does it support the core principles of ICN (cooperative ownership, subsidiarity, regenerating resources, verifiable trust, etc.)?
*   Which stakeholders (individuals, cooperatives, communities, federations, developers) does this primarily affect or benefit?

## Design

This is the core of the RFC. Describe the proposed design in sufficient detail for it to be understood and evaluated.

*   **High-Level Technical Description**: Explain the overall approach and architecture of the proposed solution.
*   **Detailed Design**: Include specifics such as:
    *   Data structures and formats.
    *   API changes (if any).
    *   Protocol modifications (if any).
    *   Algorithm descriptions.
    *   User interactions and experience (if applicable).
    *   Security considerations.
*   **Governance Model** (if applicable): Describe any new or modified governance processes, roles, or rules.
*   **Examples**: Provide concrete examples to illustrate the proposal.
*   **Diagrams**: Use Mermaid syntax or ASCII art for diagrams if helpful.

```mermaid
;; Optional: Example Mermaid diagram
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>Alice: Great!
```

## Compatibility

*   **Breaking Changes**: List any breaking changes this RFC introduces to existing APIs, protocols, or user workflows.
*   **Backwards Compatibility**: How will this change affect older versions or existing deployments? Is it backwards compatible?
*   **Migration Steps**: If there are breaking changes, outline any necessary migration steps for users or node operators.
*   **Version Requirements**: Specify any dependencies on particular versions of ICN components or other systems.

## Alternatives Considered

Describe other approaches or solutions that were considered and why the proposed design was chosen over them. What are the trade-offs?

## Prior Art & Influences

*   Mention any existing systems, protocols, papers, or ideas that influenced this RFC (e.g., ActivityPub, Matrix, IPFS, specific academic research).
*   How does this proposal relate to or differ from them?

## Unresolved Questions & Future Considerations

*   List any open questions or aspects of the design that still need to be figured out.
*   What are potential future enhancements or related work that could build upon this RFC?
