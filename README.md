# InterCooperative Network (ICN) Documentation

The InterCooperative Network (ICN) is a digital-commons platform designed for verifiable compute, regenerating economics, decentralized identity, and deliberative governance. It aims to provide neutral, federated infrastructure that cooperatives, communities, and individuals can own, trust, and collaboratively govern. ICN leverages WASM runtimes for auditable computation, a unique *mana*-based resource system, DID-based identities for all participants, and the AgoraNet platform for participatory decision-making.

## üìú Purpose of This Repository

This repository (`icn-docs`) serves as the **canonical source of truth** for all InterCooperative Network documentation. All content herein is written in Markdown and is mirrored to the public documentation website at [https://intercooperative.network/docs](https://intercooperative.network/docs). We strive to maintain clear, accurate, and comprehensive information to support developers, users, and contributors to the ICN ecosystem.

## üß≠ Documentation Sections

This repository is organized into the following top-level sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of ICN:

*   **`onboarding/`**: Guides for new users, developers, and communities to get started with setting up, participating in, and contributing to ICN.
*   **`philosophy/`**: Explores the core principles, vision, and ethical considerations that underpin the ICN project‚Äîthe "why" behind our efforts.
*   **`architecture/`**: Details the system design, component interactions, federation layering, and overall technical structure of the network.
*   **`rfcs/` (Requests for Comments)**: A collection of proposals, discussions, and decisions related to governance, protocol changes, and significant feature developments.
*   **`api/`**: Reference documentation for ICN's Application Programming Interfaces, including REST endpoints and other programmatic interfaces.
*   **`cli/`**: Manuals and guides for command-line interface (CLI) tools such as `meshctl` (for network interaction) and `runtimectl` (for managing compute nodes).
*   **`economy/`**: Describes the ICN economic model, focusing on *mana*‚Äîthe regenerating, identity-scoped resource for compute and exchange‚Äîits logic, and its role in the ecosystem.
*   **`governance/`**: Outlines the mechanisms for federated decision-making, voting procedures, policy enforcement, and the roles of different entities (Individuals, Cooperatives, Communities, Federations) within ICN.
*   **`networking/`**: Information on the underlying network infrastructure, including the use of libp2p for the peer-to-peer mesh, routing protocols, and subnet configurations.
*   **`observability/`**: Details on monitoring, metrics (Prometheus), logging, and the audit infrastructure designed to ensure transparency and reliability.

## üå± Getting Started

If you are new to the InterCooperative Network, we recommend starting with:

1.  **`philosophy/`**: To understand the vision and core principles driving ICN.
2.  **`onboarding/`**: For practical steps on how to engage with the network.

## ü§ù Contributing

ICN is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions to the documentation and the platform itself! Whether you're fixing a typo, clarifying a concept, or adding a new section, your input is valuable.
