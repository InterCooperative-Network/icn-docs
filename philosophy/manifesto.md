# The ICN Manifesto

- No monarchs.
- No bosses.
- No shareholders demanding infinite growth.

Instead:

- Cooperatives, communities, and federations.
- Infrastructure for peopleâ€”not empires.
- Tools to deliberate, decide, and govern together.

We don't need permission.  
We don't need venture capital.  
We don't need the state's blessing.

We have each other.

Build. Fork. Federate.
