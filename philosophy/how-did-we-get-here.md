# How Did We Get Here?

## The Age of Extraction

Corporations own the internet.  
States surveil and punish.  
People are isolated, overwhelmed, and exploited.

This system cannot be patched. It must be replaced.

## Our Premise

A better future demands:
- Infrastructure owned by people
- Economic logic based on regeneration
- Federation, not centralization
- Deliberation, not domination

That's why we built ICN.
