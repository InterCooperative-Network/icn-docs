# Contributing to ICN Governance

The InterCooperative Network (ICN) is designed to be governed by its participants. Contributing to governance means helping shape the rules, policies, protocols, and future direction of the network. This is primarily done through the Request for Comments (RFC) process and participation in community discussions.

## Understanding ICN Governance

ICN governance aims to be:

*   **Decentralized**: Avoiding single points of control.
*   **Deliberative**: Encouraging discussion and consensus-building.
*   **Federated**: Allowing for autonomy at different scales (individuals, cooperatives, communities, federations).
*   **Transparent**: Making processes and decisions open and auditable.

Key elements include:
*   **RFCs**: Formal proposals for changes or new features.
*   **AgoraNet**: A platform intended for real-time debate, proposal refinement, and potentially voting (details to be finalized as AgoraNet is developed and deployed).
*   **Reputation**: An individual's or entity's standing within the network, which may influence governance in some contexts.
*   **Voting Mechanisms**: Specific voting rules will be defined for different scopes (e.g., cooperative-level decisions, federation-wide protocol changes). These will be detailed in the `../governance/` section.

## How to Participate

1.  **Join the Discussion**: The primary venue for discussing governance ideas, proposals, and ongoing RFCs is the [InterCooperative Network GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/InterCooperative-Network/discussions).

2.  **Understand Existing Policies**: Familiarize yourself with the content in the `../governance/` directory, which will contain established policies, and the `../philosophy/` directory for the core principles of ICN.

3.  **Proposing an RFC**:
    If you have an idea for a significant change, a new feature, or a modification to a core protocol or policy, the formal way to propose it is through an RFC.
    *   **Use the Template**: Start by copying the `../rfcs/0000-template.md` to a new file in the `rfcs/` directory. Name it `XXXX-your-rfc-title.md`, where `XXXX` is the next available number (or leave as `0000` initially if submitting via a PR).
    *   **Fill out the Template**: Address all sections of the template: Summary, Motivation, Design, Compatibility, Alternatives, Prior Art.
    *   **Initial Discussion (Optional but Recommended)**: Before formally submitting, you might want to float your idea in the GitHub Discussions to gather early feedback.
    *   **Submit a Pull Request**: Create a Pull Request to the `icn-docs` repository with your new RFC. This initiates the formal review process.

4.  **Reviewing and Commenting on RFCs**:
    *   Browse open Pull Requests for new RFCs in `icn-docs`.
    *   Read through existing RFCs in the `rfcs/` directory.
    *   Provide constructive feedback, ask clarifying questions, and discuss implications either directly on the Pull Request or in the relevant AgoraNet room (once available and linked from the RFC).

5.  **Voting (Future)**:
    *   Once AgoraNet and formal voting mechanisms are fully implemented, accepted RFCs may proceed to a voting stage according to the rules outlined in the `../governance/README.md` (or a dedicated policy document).
    *   Participation in voting may be tied to DID identity and potentially reputation or membership in specific cooperatives/communities.

## Scope of Governance

Governance contributions can cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

*   Protocol upgrades and changes.
*   Economic model adjustments (e.g., mana regeneration rates, transaction fees).
*   Identity and reputation system modifications.
*   Dispute resolution mechanisms.
*   Policies for network access and resource allocation.
*   Funding for community initiatives.

## Important Considerations

*   **Be Constructive**: Engage in discussions respectfully and focus on the merits of proposals.
*   **Consider the Ecosystem**: Think about how your proposal impacts different stakeholders (individuals, coops, communities, federations) and the overall health of the ICN.
*   **Clarity is Key**: Clearly articulate the problem you are trying to solve and the details of your proposed solution.

This guide provides an initial overview. As ICN's governance model and tools like AgoraNet mature, this documentation will be updated with more specific procedures.

Your participation is essential for a thriving, cooperatively-governed network!
